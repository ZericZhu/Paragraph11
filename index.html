<p>I used to think that rain was romantic. That it held possibility. It smells fresh and delicious and intoxicating and it whispers of new beginnings as it pounds against the ground.</p>

<p>Whenithjjh 
  rained, you could imagine your car breaking down. You could imagine someone stopping their car to help youout	the rain plastering their hair to their face and soaking you both. You could imagine leaning in closer to them with the roaring of the storm in your ears and smelling damp earth on them and kissing, with rain pattering relentle
  
  ssly on top of the two of you, while the wind blew and you both froze.</p>

<p>But it would be alright. Being cold doesn't matter half so much if you're cold with someone else. I always thought rain was like that, so wonderful and fresh and exciting and romantic.</p>
